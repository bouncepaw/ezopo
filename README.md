# Ezopo (WARNING: WIP)
Static site generator.

## Specifics
1. Engine is not aiming to be user-frinedly,
2. Engine generates ready HTML files, that one can use any way they want:
   1. GitHub Pages,
   2. Surge,
   3. Own server,
   4. Locally,
   5. etc.
3. Pages are written in `.md` files,
4. Dead-simple plugin system.

## Installation
I will make shard someday, for now use `ezopo.cr`.

## Usage
Read more about usage in `usage.md` file.
